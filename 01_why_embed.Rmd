# Why embed content? 

## Why include "media"? 
<div class="columns-2">

The benefits of the web (over a static document) are: 

- access to up to date information
- adding external image/video sources without worrying about copyright
- **interactive** widgets can support the flow of learning, assessment for learning, exploration, etc

<br>
I'll talk about the downsides later...

# How? | Embedding content

## The gitbook format is a fully functioning website! 
<div class="columns-2">

<img src="./images/undraw_Online_information_re_erks.png" alt="person looking at image large web browser window" width=500px>

You can include:

- links
- image/video embeds 
- webpage/webapp embeds (e.g. twitter feed, desmos graphical calculator)
- inline html, javascript, css with `<tags>` <br> (e.g. `<p>Markup you markdown!<\p>`)

</div>

## Adding links {.smaller}
<div class="columns-2">


### Links: {-}

- are simple
- work in all formats (including PDF)
- give students control over accessing resource

### Accessibility tips for links: {-} 
- use descriptive links where possible (e.g. [Join the bookdown usergroup](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a796c455c3a5a4badbfbcb5434d869e98%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=1485fec3-9ca3-443b-94ae-f8fb7d07bd98&tenantId=377e3d22-4ea1-422d-b0ad-8fcc89406b9e) instead of [https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a...](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a796c455c3a5a4badbfbcb5434d869e98%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=1485fec3-9ca3-443b-94ae-f8fb7d07bd98&tenantId=377e3d22-4ea1-422d-b0ad-8fcc89406b9e))
- don't force users to open links in new tab/window

</div>

## Adding images from the web
<div class="columns-2">
[Educational Exceptions](https://teachinghub.bath.ac.uk/the-bath-blend/essentials/copyright/): you can use copyrighted images (e.g. figure from journal) in your lecture notes if:

1. it is for internal student use
2. it directly illustrates the content

It can be useful to point to an image on the web if you:

- host publicly (e.g. github)
- use cat .gifs to support learning!

<img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/copyright.jpg" alt="xkcd cartoon with balloon text sometimes I just can't get outraged over copyright law." width=450px>

</div>

## Adding videos

Copy and paste the embed code from *any* site - including Panopto!

<iframe src="https://uniofbath.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=9359f6d0-d0eb-4265-a2f5-ab2000f38035&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=false&captions=false&interactivity=all" height="300px" width="50%" style="border: 1px solid #464646;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay"></iframe>


Note: this Panopto video has [quiz questions](https://teachinghub.bath.ac.uk/how-to-use-review-for-staff/#add_quiz) as you play through it!


## Embedding other web content

<div class="columns-2">

- [Desmos graphing calculator](https://www.desmos.com)
- [Xerte](https://teachinghub.bath.ac.uk/tools-and-resources/tel/xerte-online-toolkits/) (see quiz example)
- [Microsoft Forms](https://teachinghub.bath.ac.uk/microsoft-forms/) (general polls don't show the results to student, but quiz allows you to give individuals instant feedback after all question have been submitted)
- [Mentimeter](https://teachinghub.bath.ac.uk/polling-with-mentimeter/) results slides (this is NOT for voting as audience paced voting slides don't show the results)
- Twitter feed
- A webpage (*tread carefully*)
