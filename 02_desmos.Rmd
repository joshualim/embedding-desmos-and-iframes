## Desmos at a glance

<div class="columns-2">
### Why use Desmos? {-}

- *Interactive* - students can play with parameters
- Fast to create (+ easy animation)
- [Digitally Accessible](https://help.desmos.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404860698253-What-Accessibility-features-does-Desmos-offer-)
<!-- display and text can be altered (zoom in, fonts, high contrast, etc) and works with screen readers (e.g.  create audible representation of the graphs to convey amplitude and intercepts audibly -->
- Free
<br>

### Plotting in desmos {-}
- 2D Cartesian/polar coordinates
- Domain/range restrictions/piecewise functions, 
- Shade area with inequalities, Differentiation, ...
- Paste [tabular data](https://help.desmos.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405489674381-Tables) from clipboard (1000 points) and [fit](https://help.desmos.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406972958733-Regressions) 

</div>

## Making plots in Desmos
1. Sign up for a free account on [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com)
2. Create graph ([see Graphing Calculator: Essential Skills](https://help.desmos.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405305421709-Graphing-Calculator-Essential-Skills))
3. Copy embed code

### Desmos Tips {-}
- Add points on graph for quick sliders in the embed


## How to embed a Desmos graph 

1. Get the embed code from Desmos
2. Paste in embed code to .Rmd file 
3. Change some embed code parameters
    -  `width="100%"`
    -  `height="500px"` (even 600px is probably ok even for iphone)
4. Add a direct link (fallback for PDF and the *edit on desmos* button doesn't display on mobile)

## Adding a Desmos embed as a figure

Same as a "normal" bookdown figure but instead of `knitr::include_graphics()` use `knitr::include_url(URL)`

### Example {-}
```{r echo=FALSE, wavesanim , out.width='70%', fig.show='hold', fig.cap="[View Travelling and standing wave plot](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qy6jc8mfi9). Upper: two identical but counter-propogating travelling waves will result in a standing wave below. "}
knitr::include_url("https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qy6jc8mfi9?embed")
```

### Bookdown Source {-}

````{verbatim, lang = "r"}

```
{r echo=FALSE, wavesanim , out.width='70%', fig.show='hold',  fig.cap="[View Travelling and standing wave plot](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qy6jc8mfi9). Upper: two identical but counter-propogating travelling waves will result in a standing wave below. "}
knitr::include_url("https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qy6jc8mfi9?embed")
```
````

### Figure embed notes {-}

- Note: the figure referencing doesn't work for in ioslides (you are unlikely to be cross-referencing anyway)
- Reference as usual with `\@ref(fig:label)` (e.g. `\@ref(fig:wavesanim)` becomes Figure \@ref(fig:wavesanim))
- Captions make good places to links to graph

## Desmos shortcomings {.build}

- The embed only shows the plot, but *not* the left hand panel - you have to add sliders or student visit page to view the source
- Not all Greek letters letters recognised! ([Fix: Chrome/Edge addin for full Greek alphabet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/desmos-more-greek-letters/ehedmkmgdeekblhmnogcdimeohjilkjb?hl=en#)
- No permalinks - Desmos updates URL after each save
- Graphs are public - don't put any personal/private data there
- It's possible but generally not recommended to embed the whole calculator (see \@ref(sec:embed-whole-desmos))

### What about my PDFs/offline support? {-}
If there is no connection to the internet, the iframe will *not* load.

If you compile to a PDF, nothing is displayed, which is why a link is important! Possibly, one can do something clever in R to add use an image if knit to PDF...

- It's easy to  embed web content with bookdown
- Embeds don't work for offline/PDF use
- Desmos is free, interactive for students and easy to use: give it a try!
