The benefits of the web (over a static document) are: access to up to date information adding external image/video sources without worrying about copyright interactive widgets can support the flow of learning, assessment for learning, exploration, etc Ill talk about the downsides later "],["how-embedding-content.html", "2 How? | Embedding content 2.1 The gitbook format is a fully functioning website! 2.2 Adding links 2.3 Adding images from the web 2.4 Adding videos 2.5 Embedding other web content", " 2 How? | Embedding content 2.1 The gitbook format is a fully functioning website! You can include: links image/video embeds webpage/webapp embeds (e.g. twitter feed, desmos graphical calculator) inline html, javascript, css with &lt;tags&gt; (e.g. &lt;p&gt;Markup you markdown!&lt;\\p&gt;) 2.2 Adding links Links: are simple work in all formats (including PDF) give students control over accessing resource Accessibility tips for links: use descriptive links where possible (e.g. Join the bookdown usergroup instead of https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a) dont force users to open links in new tab/window 2.3 Adding images from the web Educational Exceptions: you can use copyrighted images (e.g. figure from journal) in your lecture notes if: it is for internal student use it directly illustrates the content It can be useful to point to an image on the web if you: host publicly (e.g. github) use cat .gifs to support learning! 2.4 Adding videos Copy and paste the embed code from any site - including Panopto! Note: this Panopto video has quiz questions as you play through it! 2.5 Embedding other web content Desmos graphing calculator Xerte (see quiz example) Microsoft Forms (general polls dont show the results to student, but quiz allows you to give individuals instant feedback after all question have been submitted) Mentimeter results slides (this is NOT for voting as audience paced voting slides dont show the results) Twitter feed A webpage (tread carefully) "],["desmos-a-simple-interactive-graphing-calculator.html", "3 Desmos | a simple &amp; interactive graphing calculator 3.1 Desmos graphing calculator 3.2 Desmos at a glance 3.3 Making plots in Desmos 3.4 How to embed a Desmos graph 3.5 Adding a Desmos embed as a figure 3.6 Desmos shortcomings 3.7 Take away messages", " 3 Desmos | a simple &amp; interactive graphing calculator 3.1 Desmos graphing calculator View Damped Harmonic Oscillator View Travelling and standing wave plot 3.2 Desmos at a glance Why use Desmos?

Upper: two identical but counter-propogating travelling waves will result in a standing wave below. Bookdown Source {r echo=FALSE, wavesanim , out.width=70%, fig.show=hold, fig.cap=View Travelling and standing wave plot. Upper: two identical but counter-propogating travelling waves will result in a standing wave below.} knitr::include_url(https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qy6jc8mfi9?embed) Figure embed notes Note: the figure referencing doesnt work for in ioslides (you are unlikely to be cross-referencing anyway) Reference as usual with \\@ref(fig:label) (e.g. \\@ref(fig:wavesanim) becomes Figure 3.1) Captions make good places to links to graph 3.6 Desmos shortcomings The embed only shows the plot, but not the left hand panel - you have to add sliders or student visit page to view the source Not all Greek letters letters recognised! (Fix: Chrome/Edge addin for full Greek alphabet No permalinks - Desmos updates URL after each save Graphs are public - dont put any personal/private data there Its possible but generally not recommended to embed the whole calculator (see 4.1) What about my PDFs/offline support? If there is no connection to the internet, the iframe will not load. If you compile to a PDF, nothing is displayed, which is why a link is important! Possibly, one can do something clever in R to add use an image if knit to PDF 3.7 Take away messages Its easy to embed web content with bookdown Embeds dont work for offline/PDF use Desmos is free, interactive for students and easy to use: give it a try! "],["sec-appendicies.html", "4 Appendicies 4.1 Embedding the whole Desmos calculator 4.2 General tips for iframes and bookdown 4.3 iframes and accessibility pitfalls", " 4 Appendicies 4.1 Embedding the whole Desmos calculator This is not generally recommended: if you alter a parameter, you get an annoying do you want to leave this page when trying to read next page can be a squeeze on smaller screens 4.2 General tips for iframes and bookdown dont have too many iframes per page (can be slow to load, take up resources) student interactions arent persistent and nothing gets saved: they get reloaded by a student every time they visit a page Consider mobile/tablet users where the screen sizes are smaller: sometimes a link is better? Avoid sites with advertising or a cookie requests that distracts from the content. there isnt always much space, so pick simple things to embed (bookdown has comfortable margins) an iframe wont display for students if theyre offline or viewing the PDF. 4.3 iframes and accessibility pitfalls There are no intrinsic accessibility issues with iframes. However not all iframes work nicely on mobile browsers. the organization of the pages may not be clear to screen readers. navigation (via keyboard or due to increased zoom/limited size) can be challenging. Accessibility suggestions Test how it appears on your phone Pick shorter/simple pages or sites that generate an embed code, rather than write your own. Present a direct link alternative Stock images from undraw (open source, colour-customisable images that can be used without attribution) "]]
